# osLab-microLab
Repository for Operating Systems Lab and Microcomputers Lab projects at ECE NTUA.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains solutions and materials for both:
- **Operating Systems Laboratory** (system calls, kernel development, filesystems, drivers)
- **Microcontrollers Laboratory** (assembly and C ATmega328PB programming, sensors, interfaces)
Refer to the individual lab directories for specific exercises and implementations and their README files for detailed instructions.

## Operating Systems Lab
1. **System Call Riddle**  
   - Environment manipulation challenges
   - Process/File/Network operations

2. **Sensor Driver Development**  
   - Character device driver implementation  
   - Concurrent access handling  
   - Blocking/non-blocking I/O

3. **ext2 Filesystem Implementation**  
   - ext2 structure analysis  
   - Kernel-level ext2-lite implementation  
   - Inode/directory operations

## Microcontrollers Lab
1. **Basic I/O**: ATmega328 assembly programming with timers and simulations  
2. **Interrupts**: External INT handling with debouncing and LED control  
3. **PWM/ADC**: Timer1 PWM generation and analogue sensor reading  
4. **LCD Display**: Voltage measurement display via ADC and LCD  
5. **I2C Expansion**: Port expansion and logical function implementation  
6. **Keypad**: Matrix scanning with debouncing and electronic lock  
7. **1-Wire**: DS1820 temperature sensor communication protocol  
8. **IoT System**: Wireless patient monitoring with ESP8266, UART and Wifi communication, and web server integration
