# Operating Systems Lab: Riddle Challenge

## Overview
This exercise presents a series of system-level challenges that test understanding of:
- File system operations
- Process management
- Inter-process communication
- Memory mapping
- Network operations

## Objectives
- Solve challenges up to Tier2 level
- Demonstrate working solutions
- Explain the operating system concepts behind each solution

## Constraints
During examination:
-  No `LD_PRELOAD` mechanism
-  No debuggers
-  No binary modification

## Key Concepts Tested
The challenges involve:
1. **File System Operations**
   - File creation/permissions
   - Hard links
   - Sparse files

2. **Process Control**
   - Signal handling
   - Process forking
   - Process memory inspection

3. **IPC Mechanisms**
   - Named pipes
   - File descriptor manipulation
   - Shared memory

4. **Network Operations**
   - Socket communication

5. **Dynamic Linking**
   - Shared object creation

## Methodology
1. Monitor program behavior
2. Analyze system calls
3. Modify execution environment
4. Create supporting programs/scripts

## Verification
Solutions must:
- Be implemented without prohibited methods
- Work in isolated environment
- Demonstrate understanding of underlying OS concepts
